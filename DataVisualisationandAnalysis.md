# Data Visualisation and Analysis

## Reminders
* There are 103 companies in the sample

## Keys takeaways
* 2% of the companies are extraordinary, 10% uncommon and the rest 88% are common companies.
  * Non-traditional companies are common companies in the global energy market
    * They all are generating less the 200 billion € and have less than 100k employees
*  There is a lot of potential for renewables
    * The average company in Renewables makes around 12 billion €.
    * This is as much as McKinsey and almost as Decathlon in 2022.
      
## Detailed analysis

### Employees number per yearly revenues

After I built the chart, I decided to split the sample into 3 categories: common, uncommon, and extraordinary

The first category "common" gathers 91 companies, which accounts for 88% of the total number of companies.
Falling into this category means that 
* They have been generating less than 200 billion € at the end of the studied year.
* They also have less than 100k employees
* All Non-traditional companies fall into this category

Next is the "uncommon" category. Those companies were either too big or too profitable, but not enough to be extraordinary. This category accounts for 10% of the total sample.
* They either generate more than 200 billion €
* Or have more than 100k employees

Finally is the last category ("extraordinary"), which corresponds to 2% of the sample
* Companies from the category earn more than 200 billion € and have more than 100k employees
* There are only 2 companies in this case

### Average revenue for Renewables companies

The average revenue for a renewable company is almost 12 billion €. In comparison, the average for the total sample is 63 billion €. 
The French sporting goods retailer Decathlon generated 15 billion € in 2022 and the consulting company McKinsey made €12B. It is interesting because it shows the huge potential of the renewables market in sales.

### Revenue distribution
The distribution is negatively exponential, which means that most of the company don't generate that much compared to a small part of companies that make a lot of revenues from sales.

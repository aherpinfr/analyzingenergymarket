After I built the chart, I decided to split the sample into 3 categories: common, uncommon, and extraordinary

The first category "common" gathers 91 companies, which accounts for 88% of the total number of companies.
Falling into this category means that 
* They have been generating less than 200 billion € at the end of the studied year.
* They also have less than 100k employees

Next is the "uncommon" category. Those companies were either too big or too profitable, but not enough to be extraordinary. This category accounts for 10% of the total sample.
* They either generate more than 200 billion €
* Or have more than 100k employees

Finally is the last category ("extraordinary"), which corresponds to 2% of the sample
* Companies from the category earn more than 200 billion € and have more than 100k employees
* There are only 2 companies in this case

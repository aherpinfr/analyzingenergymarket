# Analyzing the energy market
## Context of the project
This analysis aims to get an insight into the energy market at a global scale. 
I wanted to understand how big companies in the renewables market like Vestas Wind Systems were compared to more traditional companies like Saudi Aramco.
I know for example that the oil market generates a lot of revenue but wanted to see it clearer on a chart compared to other markets like hydrogen or solar.
The building of the chart is going to be made further with Power BI but.

I am also interested in discovering companies that gather the following criteria:
- The company works in solar, hydrogen or hydro turbines
- The company is international
- Employees are communicating at least english
- There are opportuinities in Germany, the Neterlands, Belgium or Vietnam

## Sample size
In total, I collected information on 105 companies that I categorized into one of the 6 following categories

Installer
Investor
Manufacturer
Renewables
Support
Traditional

# Searching for a specific type of company working in energy then analyzing the market

## Introduction

### Context of the project
This analysis aims to get an insight into the energy market at a global scale. 
I wanted to understand how big companies in the renewables market were compared to more traditional companies.
I know that the oil market generates a lot of revenue but I would like to see it on a chart compared to other markets like hydrogen or solar.

### Goals of the project
The first goal of the project is to write a series of queries that will enable me to understand the database
The second goal of the project is to create a Dashboard with a chart:
 - The chart will analyze the number of employees in each company compared to its revenues
 - The different categories will be highlighted wit colors in the chart 

### Sample size 
In total, I collected information on 105 companies that I categorized into one of the 6 following categories

Installer
Investor
Manufacturer
Renewables
Support
Traditional

### Tools 
Data have been stored in a SQL Server database in a table named "COMPANIES".
The building of the chart is going to be made further with Power BI. 

### Limits
Several companies - like Engie - are in a fuzzy zone because they are investing in both renewables and fossils. For those companies, I asked Chatgpt in which category the bot would put the company and applied the recommendation.

## Analyzing the database

My first idea was to get statistics on the number of companies in each category in my sample

```sql
SELECT Category, COUNT(Category) AS Count FROM COMPANIES
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY Count DESC
```

As you can see, traditional companies account for almost 50% of the total number of companies in the sample, while renewables account for around 27%.

Then I wanted to understand what does it mean it terms of revenues

```sql
SELECT Category, COUNT(Category) AS Count FROM COMPANIES
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY Count DESC
```

As we can see,  94% of the revenues in the table are generated by traditional companies, while 5% by renewables.

I know that all my revenue data have not been taken in the same year, though. I'll first search for the column that store the year

```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME ='COMPANIES';
```

There is a column "year_revenuettm" that can be shown to get the statistics on when data on revenues have been stored.

```sql
SELECT year_revenuettm, COUNT(Category) AS Count FROM COMPANIES
GROUP BY year_revenuettm
ORDER BY Count DESC
```

# Searching for a specific type of company working in energy then analyzing the market
## Context of the project
This analysis aims to get an insight into the energy market at a global scale. 
I wanted to understand how big companies in the renewables market like Vestas Wind Systems were compared to more traditional companies like Saudi Aramco.
I know that the oil market generates a lot of revenue but I would like to see it on a chart compared to other markets like hydrogen or solar.

The building of the chart is going to be made further with Power BI. 
I am firstly interested in finding that informations
- How much the companies working in solar, hydrogen, or hydro turbines are doing compared to the top and bottom of the sample


## Sample size 
In total, I collected information on 105 companies that I categorized into one of the 6 following categories

Installer
Investor
Manufacturer
Renewables
Support
Traditional

## Limits
Several companies - like Engie - are in a fuzzy zone because they are investing in both renewables and fossils. For those companies, I asked Chatgpt in which category the bot would put the company and applied the recommendation.

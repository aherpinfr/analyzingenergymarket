# Searching for a specific type of company working in energy then analyzing the market

## Introduction

### Context of the project
This analysis aims to get an insight into the energy market at a global scale. 
I wanted to understand how big companies in the renewables market were compared to more traditional companies.
I know that the oil market generates a lot of revenue but I would like to see it on a chart compared to other markets like hydrogen or solar.

### Goals of the project
The first goal of the project is to write a series of queries that will enable me to understand the database

The second goal of the project is to create a Dashboard with a chart:
* The chart will analyze the number of employees in each company compared to its revenues
* The different categories will be highlighted wit colors in the chart 

### Sample size 
In total, I collected information on 105 companies that I categorized into one of the 6 following categories

Installer
Investor
Manufacturer
Renewables
Support
Traditional

### Tools 
Data have been stored in a SQL Server database in a table named "COMPANIES".
The building of the chart is going to be made further with Power BI. 

### Limits
Several companies - like Engie - are in a fuzzy zone because they are investing in both renewables and fossils. For those companies, I asked Chatgpt in which category the bot would put the company and applied the recommendation.

## Analyzing the database
### Key takeways
* 50% of the companies are traditional, 27% are renewables, 23% are one of the fourth other categories
* 94% of the revenues are generated by a traditional company, 5% by a renewable, 1% by one of the others
* Almost 90% of the employees are working for a traditional company, and 6% for renewables.
* On average there are more employees in a manufacturing or support company than in renewables, although renewables are generating more revenue

### Revenue Analysis
My first idea was to get statistics on the number of companies in each category in my sample

```sql
SELECT Category, COUNT(Category) AS Count FROM COMPANIES
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY Count DESC
```

As you can see, traditional companies account for almost 50% of the total number of companies in the sample, while renewables account for around 27%.

Then I wanted to understand what it means in terms of revenues

```sql
SELECT Category, COUNT(Category) AS Count, 
sum(revenue_ttm) AS revenue,
avg(revenue_ttm) As avg_revenues
FROM COMPANIES
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY avg_revenues DESC
```

As we can see,  94% of the revenues in the table are generated by traditional companies, while 5% by renewables.

I know that all my revenue data have not been taken in the same year, though. I'll first search for the column that stores the year.

```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME ='COMPANIES';
```

There is a column "year_revenuettm" that can be shown to get the statistics on when data on revenues have been stored.

```sql
SELECT year_revenuettm, COUNT(Category) AS Count FROM COMPANIES
GROUP BY year_revenuettm
ORDER BY Count DESC
```

As we can see in the picture above, 99% of revenue data have been retrieved within three years of range.

### Employees analysis
After having analyzed the sample on the revenue metric, I am going to compare the number of employees by category.

```sql
SELECT Category, COUNT(Category) AS Count, 
sum(Nb_employees)As total_employees,
avg(Nb_employees) As avg_nb_of_em
FROM COMPANIES
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY Count DESC
```

There is a total of 2 845 956 employees, almost 90% of which are working for a traditional company, and 6% for renewables.
On average there are more employees in a manufacturing or support company than in renewables, although renewables are generating more revenues.

## Conclusion
Even if they are not a majority (they are less the 50% of the total number of companies), companies in the traditional sector account for almost all revenues and employees. 
There is also a share for renewables companies (around 5%).
